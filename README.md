Client implementation using OT infrastructure. Experiments with a range
of different underlying models:
* Simple text entry.
* A chess board.
* A form for coming to agreement on something, e.g. a time, date or place to meet (think doodle).
* A planning app (think trello).

These provide examples of using the basic underlying types (string, array, maps) to build up
a more complex data model for an actual application.
